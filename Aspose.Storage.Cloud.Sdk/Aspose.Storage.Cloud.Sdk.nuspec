    <releaseNotes>
      Aspose.Storage Cloud SDK for .NET 1.0.11 Release Notes
      This is fully reworked version of .NET Cloud SDK. Notable advantages over previous generation include the following:
      * Classes, methods and properties have comments and are IDE-friendly
      * Better security
      * Usage of Request/Response classes to represent long lists of parameters. This allows for cleaner code and easier backwards-compatibility going forward.
